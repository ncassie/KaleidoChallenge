# KaleidoChallenge

This is my implementation of the problem in the Pre-Interview Coding Challenge.

It was coded in Java using Maven.

To build the project, go to the main project directory and run:
	mvn clean build
	
Once the jar file is created, it can be run using:
	java -cp target/kaleidochallenge-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar ncassie.App
	
The App.main method has print statements demonstrating the program flow
	
One Unit test has been created and can be run using:
	mvn test
	
Additional unit tests can be added and run the same way.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
